MosaicSlicer is a browser-based 3D printing slicer. Everything runs completely within your web browser, and nothing is sent to any servers or cloud services. It uses [CuraEngine](https://github.com/ading2210/CuraEngine) for the slicer backend and is mostly compatible with existing [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura) printer profiles.

Note: MosaicSlicer is alpha quality software and probably has behavior that is slightly different from Cura. Please double check the generated G-code files in another G-code viewer before printing anything.

## Building

This build process has been tested to work on Linux and MacOS.

Make sure you have all submodules cloned:

```
$ git submodule update --init --progress
```

Compile CuraEngine:

```
$ scripts/build_cura.sh
```

Bundle Resources:

```
$ scripts/bundle_resources.sh
```

Install JS dependencies:

```
$ npm i
```

Bundle JS with Webpack:

```
$ npm run build:prod
```

The final output will be in `dist/`
